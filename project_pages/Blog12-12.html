                Honestly, I did not start off strong with the first week. Our theme was Weird Pong, basically Pong but
                reimagined with our own twist. I experimented with Unity’s 3D physics for a bit and tried to combine 2D
                elements with 3D ones. But, I have bitten more than I can chew, so the prototype of this week was
                completely incomplete. However, it did teach me a good lesson in how variable it is to have good time
                management.

                This week was definitely better than last week, at least I had a complete prototype for the week. Due to
                the nature of a game like Wario-Ware, I did find that when functionality of a game is broken down into
                smaller chunks, it is easier to program said functions. From that week’s feedback, I also got the first
                taste of the importance of teaching players the skills for the game.<br><br>
                This struggle of effectively communicating the theme and the skill in game to the player will come up
                repeatedly throughout the rest
                of the weeks as well. On the bright side, I did come in with a plan so I was not super stressed about
                making this week’s game.

                This week was our first open theme week, and it definitely was a different experience than the two that
                came before this one. Since we had the free reign to interpret the theme, I thought of doing an
                anti-fidget game with inspiration from my favorite scene in movie, Caveat;
                The game was heavily audio and concentration based, so when it comes to the play test session, the
                condition was not the most ideal. I think the playtesting condition definitely hindered some part of the
                gameplay
                that is supposed to teach the player through the experience.<br><br> Also for this week’s attempt at
                teaching
                players the necessary skills, I tried the heavy instruction approach that some indie games have for
                their tutorials, and its effect was not super good. One noticeable occurrence is that players will
                forget the instructions, and that was probably because it was a lot to take in and there is no more
                assistance after starting the game. I knew that a game typically will add short instruction ui for
                intractable elements in game to combat this phenomenon, but I thought the game play was simple enough
                that I can get away from that and create some challenge for the players. Afterall, my main goal for this
                pedagogical process in my game is to follow a reinforcement learning pattern, as I personally dislike
                blatant tutorials in games.

                This week is about making a game around aesthetics with a camera element in it. This theme was more
                difficult for me to come up with ideas for, as I typically take priority in the technical aspects of my
                game. I ensure that the game play is close to complete and mostly bug free, and aesthetics were left on
                the back burner mostly. I decided to go with the focus of the theme and directed the majority of my
                focus to the aesthetics of the game, so the gameplay in this game was pretty simple.<br><br>This week is
                not
                completely fruitless, as I learned new topics regarding Unity Camera Rendering, and I tried to make my
                first NPC “AI.” Moreover, I also got to experiment with shaders in Unity, as they have been a topic that
                I’m heavily interested in.
