            <h2>Summary</h2>

            <p>This is an experiemental sketch that utlizes the ml5 libraries for gesture tracking and the p5 library
                for quick prototyping.Then this project was further developed for a more complete version, using gesture
                as the primary navigation tool for the website. </p>

        <div class="text-container add">
            This was originally for a two-week class assignment, in which is to create a tool for artists. I found
            that most experimental creative tools were made for typefaces and I think there could be more than that.
            Then, when I was looking over some CodeTrain videos for inspirations. I saw the video about painting in
            P5 with hand gestures, so I wanted to test the limit of this concept to see how many functionalities I
            can replicates from a typicaly art program.<br><br>

            Later on, this project is developed to push further with the idea of gesture navigation. Then, I also
            decided that the project would be a more experimental interactive experience than a tool for designer.
