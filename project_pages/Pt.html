            <p> This is a case study for an alternative interface focuses on accommodating designersâ€™ learning needs
                when they are introduced to the program.
                This page will briefly retell the process that I went through for creating this new application
                interface. A figma prototype was built for this case study.</p>

            This project focuses on creating alternatives for the current feature introduction tutorials of design
            programs. These programs prompts an interesting challenge within their onboarding process. Their tools and
            functionalities are specific in purpose and abundant in quantities. As such, their onboarding process is
            often disregarded as an valuable part of the application.
            <br><br>New users often find onboarding tutorials for their creative tools to be irrelevant and unhelpful.
            None of the information was retained by the users, thus it create a steep user learning curve. Therefore, it
            is important to restructure the traditional onboarding process to better suits users' needs. Hence, I
            prompted the question: How might we make the information more easily accessible and meaningfulr to the user?

            This project was doned in 12 weeks and I was able to collect five interviewees for the user research. The
            methofology is a combination of shadowing and interviews. After the research, I reframed my entire project
            to solve the root issue of my users' grievances with the current design program onboarding process.
