                This week was not completely open themed but it still left us with plenty of room for exercising our
                creativity. We were asked to make a game based off of a video clip, and said video clip could be taken
                from
                anywhere. I chose a scene from The Boys where the protagonist used the lasers from a super-baby to get
                out
                of a rough situation. I thought that action could work into an interesting game play mechanic, and from
                feedback, people did enjoy it despite the absurdity of it. For this prototype I tried to introduce the
                mechanics and the controls through dialogues that the player can read at the beginning of the game. I
                think
                that approach is also not super effective as it has the similar issue with week three’s instructions, as
                the
                controls can get forgotten by the player, however this doesn’t hinder too much of the experience as the
                control is simple enough that player can pick it up quicker.

                This week is also an open theme week, and for this one, I decided to make a narrative puzzle game based
                on the change of the season. This project was also the first game that had a puzzle in it, and frankly,
                the scope of this game, which ended up being too big for one week, hindered the development of the
                learning aspect of the game. In order for this game to embody its ideal final form, I would have needed
                more time as a large amount of time was spent on other mechanics and the environmental building for this
                game.<br><br>Due to the lack of playtesting on my own, there were major bugs found in the game when it
                came to the actual playtest session, and it was frustrating to see your own game just not work.
                Moreover, there were a lot of feedbacks on the player task being unclear, and there was a valuable
                lesson that came out of that failure, which is to reverse the process backward, from the most complex to
                the most simple version of your puzzle in development, as such the tasks become easier to manage.

                During week seven, we were tasked to create a game around an autonomous digital life form that has its
                needs
                and its own actions. I wanted the game to be about a creature that is both a potential threat and a
                subject
                to be taken care of by the player. I think this dichotomy would be interesting for a pet life form. For
                this
                game, I decided to go with the route of a narrative tutorial that holds the player’s hand in teaching
                all
                the tasks and the mechanics of the game. Based on the feedback, it does work alongside the consistent
                instruction reminder UI. However, this is the type of tutorial that I dislike as it takes away part of
                the
                fun of figuring things out, and it breaks the immersion of the game a little. I do have to admit it does
                get
                the job done, and I see why a lot of games use it.
