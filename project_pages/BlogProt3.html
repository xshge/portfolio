                These three weeks will be combined as they were all based on the same idea that I decided to
                extrapolate. There were two renditions of this idea; one was an active rag doll with customizable
                limbs, and the latter one, which was also the final decision was an active ragdoll that climbs. I
                had always wanted to experiment with Unity’s physics engine, so I thought an active ragdoll would be
                a fitting thing to create for this learning process.<br><br> For week eight, there was definitely a lot
                of
                time that was put in for creating a usable ragdoll, and after creating it, I also came to the
                realization that making parts customizable would most likely mess up the balance of the doll. Due to
                the complexity of the task, I scratched the idea and I just made a ragdoll that players can put
                accessories on while playing in the playground environment that I set up. I was proud of what I was
                able to achieve, and I also learned about Scriptable Objects in Unity. Also, people enjoyed the
                wacky nature of the ragdoll and the simple task of just playing in the environment. However, I was
                not done with this ragdoll just yet.

                Week nine and ten go hand in hand, as one is just a slightly better and more experimental version of the
                other. Week nine is just about us going back and adding to one of our preexisting prototypes. I took the
                opportunity to go back and further improve my ragdoll prototype by adding a purposefully janky climbing
                ability to it, which created a gameplay that is akin to the feel of games like Getting Over It. For this
                week, I didn’t make many head waves with the level design of the game, but I did find a way to make the
                tutorials more engaging by emulating an '80s at-home workout instruction video. The instruction still
                kind of holds players’ hands, but at least it was more engaging than the pet life version.

                Week ten is an extension of week nine, as I fixed some bugs and added a procedurally generated climbing
                wall for this ragdoll. Originally, I intended the wall to be a case study of level design in A Difficult
                Game about Climbing and Getting Over It, however, with the requirement of procedural generation, this
                task has been proven to be a bit more difficult and complex for one week. There were still elements of
                intentions in this procedurally generated version of the wall, but this version still lacked the
                ambiguous path-finding elements that both games share. Also, just in general, I wished there was more
                control over the generation, but that will probably require more rules to be set. Last, at least, people
                still enjoyed it because of the challenging nature that came from controlling a ragdoll.

                This is the last week before the final, and we were tasked to create an auto battler. Honestly, if my
                event system hadn’t bug out on the last day, I would have created more levels for this game. I still
                enjoyed designing a combat system, and I wanted to design a system where the player only has defensive
                measures to ensure the safety of their villagers. In the future, I might come back to further develop
                this prototype and add the features that I ran out of time for.

                This week is our final week and it is an open theme. The duration of this project extends to the end of
                our semester, so we had plenty of time to create a complete game. The idea is to create a multi-level
                puzzle game that centers around the theme of growing brain cells by making neuron connections in the
                brain. I am pretty satisfied with the outcome and there is a <a href="GalaxBrain.html">page</a>
                dedicated to talking about the making
                of this game and the full design document is on that page as well.
