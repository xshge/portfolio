        <h2>Brainstorm</h2>
        <p>This website prototype is an extension of a previous group project that I have worked on. That project was about spreading information regarding an local environmental issue, and this website serves as a tool in educating the general masses in NYC oyster population. Moreover, I made it dynamic in how the website will response to how much time the user have spent on the page.</p>

            <p>I first protoyped the website in Figma to get a general idea in its appearance. However, I changed the color-palette drastically in the final version, as sometimes the Figma prototype also serves as a way for me to brasinstorm as well.</p>
